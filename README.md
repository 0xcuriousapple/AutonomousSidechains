Own version of Ethereum (Ethereum Implementation from scratch). 
Ethereum can be described in two words. 
It's a:  Decentralized Computer. A decentralized computer is like a normal computer. 
A normal computer executes a program using one machine.  
But a decentralized computer executes a program using multiple machines. 
Every machine needs to agree upon the output of the program for its results to become official. 
To build a decentralized computer, here are the essential elements:  
A smart contract language. 
A blockchain. 
A network. 
Transactions and accounts. 
A state management data structure.
