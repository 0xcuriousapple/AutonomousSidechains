A decentralized computer is like a normal computer. \r A normal computer executes a program using one machine.  \r But a decentralized computer executes a program using multiple machines. \r Every machine needs to agree upon the output of the program for its results to become official. \r To build a decentralized computer, here are the essential elements:  \r A smart contract language. \r A blockchain. \r A network. \r Transactions and accounts. \r A state management data structure.",
